      Reactivation makes a task eligible to be retried again up to its maximum

      retry count. The task's state is changed to active. As the task is no
      longer

      in the completed state, any previous exit code or scheduling error is no

      longer available after reactivation. This will fail for tasks that are not

      completed or that previously completed successfully (with an exit code of

      0). Additionally, this will fail if the job has completed (or is
      terminating

      or deleting).
